## Summary

Free daily AI brief from your Garmin data (Gemini and GitHub Actions)

## Content

Garmin Daily AI Insights

Free daily AI brief on your Garmin data — full-history stats, Gemini insight, push to your phone. $0 to run.

Fully automated pipeline: pull Garmin Connect into SQLite, compute percentiles and trends over your whole history, and deliver a short coached brief via ntfy, Telegram, or email. Runs on GitHub Actions; no server to maintain.

Example notification layout — your numbers and wording change daily.

What you get each morning

WATCH • Stress 34 vs 30d avg 23 — worsening • Sleep 6.15h — under 7h target WINS • Intensity 63 min — all-time high • Resting HR improving, 2-day streak near ATL TODAY In bed 30 minutes earlier tonight. — Poor sleep raises cortisol and daily stress.

Cost: $0 (Garmin via garminconnect , Gemini free tier, GitHub Actions, ntfy/Telegram/email).

1. Python environment

python3.12 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Mint Garmin token (local, once)

python scripts/mint_token.py

Use your Garmin email, password, and MFA code. Tokens are saved to ~/.garminconnect (valid ~1 year).

3. Backfill history

BACKFILL_DAYS=400 python -m src.backfill

Creates garmin.db . Commit it to your repo after backfill completes (re-run backfill after schema changes to refresh columns).

4. GitHub Actions secrets

Package tokens for CI:

tar -cf tokens.tar -C ~ /.garminconnect . base64 -i tokens.tar | tr -d '

' # macOS # Linux: base64 -w0 tokens.tar

Paste into secret GARMIN_TOKENS_B64 , then delete tokens.tar .

Secret Purpose GARMIN_TOKENS_B64 base64 tar of ~/.garminconnect GEMINI_API_KEY Google AI Studio NOTIFIER ntfy (default), telegram , or email NTFY_TOPIC long random topic (ntfy) TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN / TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID Telegram EMAIL_USER / EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD / EMAIL_TO Gmail app password

5. Notifier

ntfy (default): Install the ntfy app, subscribe to a long random topic, set NTFY_TOPIC .

Telegram: Create a bot via @BotFather, get your chat id.

Email: Gmail app password (not account password).

6. Test locally

cp .env.example .env # fill in secrets python -m src.main

Create a GitHub repo, commit everything including garmin.db , add secrets, run workflow_dispatch on garmin-daily once to verify CI. The repo can be public if you accept that garmin.db exposes daily health numbers (see below).

What goes in garmin.db (public-safe design)

Only scalar daily wellness metrics are stored. There is no raw JSON, no GPS, no activity routes, no maps, and no activity list/workout details.

Stored Not stored Steps, resting HR, sleep (duration/score/stages), stress, Body Battery high/low, HRV, training readiness, intensity minutes, active kcal Location, lat/long, track polyline SpO2, VO2 max, Garmin fitness age, weight (g), body fat % Activity names, routes, timestamps per lap Date ( YYYY-MM-DD ) only Full API responses, heart-rate streams

Fitness age is Garmin’s estimated fitness age (a single number), not your birthdate or home address.

python -m src.main — pull recent days → digest → Gemini brief → notification.

GitHub Actions runs at 13:00 UTC (~8am US Eastern), commits updated garmin.db , and pushes.

Cron drift: Scheduled runs may start a few minutes late; fine for a daily brief.

Scheduled runs may start a few minutes late; fine for a daily brief. Workflow auto-disable: Repos with no commits for 60 days disable scheduled workflows. Committing garmin.db each run prevents this.

Repos with no commits for 60 days disable scheduled workflows. Committing each run prevents this. Token expiry: Re-run scripts/mint_token.py when Actions fail auth (~yearly).

Re-run when Actions fail auth (~yearly). Gemini privacy: Free tier may use inputs for training. The digest contains only aggregated numbers — no names or emails.

Free tier may use inputs for training. The digest contains only aggregated numbers — no names or emails. Rate limits: One Gemini call/day; flash → flash-lite fallback on 429.

One Gemini call/day; flash → flash-lite fallback on 429. Thin data: Metrics with fewer than 14 days skip percentile/record claims.

Metrics with fewer than 14 days skip percentile/record claims. NULL: Missing Garmin fields are stored as NULL, never zero.

Missing Garmin fields are stored as NULL, never zero. Gemini quota 0: If you see limit: 0 429 errors, link a billing account on the GCP project tied to your API key (still $0 for one call/day within free tier).
